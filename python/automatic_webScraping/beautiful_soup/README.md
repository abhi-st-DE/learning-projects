## General-knowledge :

   1. The request library is the go to package for making HTML requests in Python. It's not a built in library in Python.
   2. Instead of using pip you could use uv for faster downloads in the virtual environments.
   3. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing structured data.


## Fun-facts : 

   1. Beautiful Soup is named after a song in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, based on its ability to tackle poorly structured HTML known as tag soup.
   2. Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the internet. Even copying and pasting the lyrics of your favorite song can be considered a form of web scraping! 

## mini-disclaimer :

   1. Using Beautiful Soup is legal because you only use it for parsing documents. Web scraping in general is also legal if you respect a website’s terms of service and copyright laws.
   2. We will build a web scraper that fetches Python software developer job listings from a fake Python job site.
